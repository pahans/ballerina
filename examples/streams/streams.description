// The `stream` type represents a stream of values in which, the constraint type of the stream defines the type of values
// accepted by the stream. Functions allowed on a stream include publishing values to the stream and/or subscribing
// to the stream to receive values that are published to the stream.
// Ballerina Streams is an experimental feature. Therefore, it requires setting the `--experimental` flag when compiling
// Ballerina files, which have streaming constructs.

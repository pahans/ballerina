// Simple filtering can be performed for the events of a stream.
// In this example, events are related to the person being monitored and there
// will be an alert triggered when there is a person whose age is less than or equal to 16.
// This example can be extended to make simple filtering based on some condition.
// Ballerina Streams is an experimental feature. Therefore, use the `--experimental` flag when
// compiling Ballerina files that have streaming constructs.

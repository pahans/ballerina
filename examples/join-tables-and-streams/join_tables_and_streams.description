//Tables and streams can be joined using streaming query logic.
//In this example, orders coming from the customers for a certain item are checked against the stock table to verify
//whether there is enough stock to deliver the order. An alert is triggered if the stock is not sufficient.
//Ballerina Streams is an experimental feature. Use the `--experimental` flag when compiling Ballerina files
//that have streaming constructs.
